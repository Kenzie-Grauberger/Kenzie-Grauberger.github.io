            <td>Welton talks about phone addiction around the world. He mentions how we may think we don't have an addiction, but makes those who are listening
                realize how much we are actaully addicted to our phones. He explains why we have that addiction and how it is formed. He also mentions how it is
                affecting our lives everyday, like going on a date and not even talking to your date.</td>

            <td>Sivers begins his Ted Talk by giving a simple example of something that is different. His example is about streets and blocks. If someone came up to 
                you and asked what block you were on, you would be confused, becuase we don't name our blocks. His example leads to how in different parts of the world, 
                they do things differently than they do in the United States. He continues his talk by stating different examples of how things are different everywhere you go.</td>

            <td>Robello begins her Ted Talk by introducing herself as an introvert. She describes what an introvert is and how you are considered one. She then talks about how being an 
                introvert is not bad. When you are an introvert, you keep your thoughts and ideas to yourself, instead of sharing it all with the world. She gives examples of popular people
                who are introverts, and how they still accomplished thier dreams. She then goes on to show how introverts are beneficial to the society.</td>

            <td>This video starts by talking about how people my age don't want to work, pay taxes, or do anything that the government wants them to do. They don't want to better themselves
                to help better others. He then explains what "win win" is and how some things aren't considered "win win." In order for a situation to be a "win win" situation, money cannot
                be asked for, in exchange of something else. He also explains how some things cannot be solved by the government itself.</td>
