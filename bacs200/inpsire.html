<p>My hero would have to be my science teacher from Junior High and High School.
  He cared about everyone, and not just in an educational way. He was always
  checking up on the students and cared about their personal life. Even after
  high school, he still checks up on all of his past students and wants them to 
  succeed in every way.</p>
